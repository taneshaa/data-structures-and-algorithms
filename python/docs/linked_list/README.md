# Singly Linked List
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Challenge

Write tests to challenge the following:

1. Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
2. Can properly insert into the linked list
3. The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
4. Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
5. Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
6. Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
7. Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

[Linked Lists](python/data_structures/linked_list.py)
[Linked Lists: Tests](python/tests/data_structures/test_linked_list.py)

## Approach & Efficiency
Took a rigorious testing approach in which I developed the functions around the pre-existing tests. First, I understood what the test required then built the function, values, and functionality from there. Big O notation for a singly linked list is O(N).
